## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Plotly
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Technical Analysis**: TA-Lib (via `ta` library)
- **Market Data**: Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance`)
- **Caching**: LRU caching for performance optimization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-analysis-dashboard.git
   cd stock-analysis-dashboard
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Access the dashboard in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Configuration

The dashboard can be configured through the sidebar:
- Select different stocks by ticker symbol
- Choose time periods from 1 day to 1 year
- Adjust time intervals from 1 minute to 1 month
- Select which technical indicators to display
- Set auto-refresh intervals



## Usage Examples

### Tracking a Stock
1. Enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL for Apple)
2. Select your desired time period and interval
3. Choose which technical indicators to display
4. Analyze price movements and technical signals

### Sentiment Analysis
1. The dashboard automatically fetches Twitter sentiment
2. View the sentiment gauge and signal
3. Combine with technical analysis for comprehensive insights

### Price Predictions
1. Navigate to the Predictions tab
2. View forecasted prices for the next 5 periods
3. Analyze potential price movements

## Performance Considerations

- Data is cached to minimize API calls
- Auto-refresh can be configured or disabled
- The application is optimized for desktop use

## Limitations

- Twitter sentiment analysis uses simulated data in this implementation (would require Twitter API access for real data)
- Price predictions are based on simple models and should not be used as sole investment advice
- Some features may be limited by Yahoo Finance API rate limits

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate real Twitter API for sentiment analysis
- [ ] Add more advanced machine learning models for predictions
- [ ] Include additional data sources (e.g., SEC filings)
- [ ] Implement portfolio tracking functionality
- [ ] Add user authentication for personalized dashboards
